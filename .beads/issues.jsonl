{"id":"stringer-xd5","title":"Empty created_at timestamps break beads import","description":"The patterns collector (and potentially others) emits `\"created_at\": \"\"` in JSONL output. Beads import rejects these with:\n\n```\nparsing time \"\" as \"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00\": cannot parse \"\" as \"2006\"\n```\n\nThis affects ~97% of signals. For example, all 10,261 pattern signals in a Home Assistant Core scan had empty timestamps and were rejected on import.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Should either omit the `created_at` field entirely, use the current timestamp as a fallback, or use a sentinel value that beads accepts.\n\n**Reproduction:** Run `stringer scan` on any repository and pipe to `bd import`. Observe that most signals fail to import due to empty timestamp fields.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"5702882+davetashner@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T12:15:25.605444-05:00","created_by":"Dave Tashner","updated_at":"2026-02-08T12:38:07.323719-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-08T12:38:07.323719-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed in fix/scan-bugs branch: added omitempty to CreatedAt JSON struct tag","labels":["bug","collector","import"]}
